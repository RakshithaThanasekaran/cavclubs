# CavClubs
CavClubs centralized website where UVA students can easily stay updated on club and CIO events. Currently, students must visit individual websites, social media pages, or rely on personal connections to learn about meetings, which makes it difficult to stay involved or explore new organizations. By consolidating this information into a single platform, our website provides a reliable space for students to browse events and learn more about various organizations across Grounds.
